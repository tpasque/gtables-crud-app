#STRETCH GOALS

1. Create a subnav bar on the index page where we can filter our search
  * Users can filter all restaurants by:
    * Rating
    * State
    * Cuisine

2. Refactor the views to use the same template for Edit and New
  * look up Express include

3. Write validations for form inputs that ensures:
  * Restaurant Name length is not longer than 40 characters
  * Location is not longer than 40 characters
  * The Image is a valid url OR file
  * Description is not empty

  *All validation functions should be written outside of your routes.*

4. Extract all database calls out of your routes and use functions that do the work for you instead.

5. When the user creates a new restaurant, or edits the restaurant information, they should be able to see their image render before submitting

6. The ability to create reservations:
  * a. When creating a restaurant, user should be able to select the meals the restaurant offers (breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, dessert)
  * b. The meals will correlate to times in 1 hour increments as such
    * Breakfast - Times 7am - 11am
    * Brunch - 9am - 2pm
    * Lunch - 11am - 2pm
    * Dinner - 5pm - 9pm
    * Dessert - 9pm - 11pm
  * c. Users should be able to Select a time to reserve on the show page
  * d. If a time is selected to reserve, a new form appears asking for:
      * First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Number in the party, Email
      * All items should have proper validations
  * e. Once the reservation is submitted, that time should disappear from the available times to reserve
  * f. Show some indication that reservations are unable
